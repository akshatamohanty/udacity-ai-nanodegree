### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [jupyter](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
- [hmmlearn](http://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Notes: 
1. It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python and load the environment included in the "Your conda env for AI ND" lesson.
2. The most recent development version of hmmlearn, 0.2.1, contains a bugfix related to the log function, which is used in this project.  In order to install this version of hmmearn, install it directly from its repo with the following command from within your activated Anaconda environment:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn.git
```

### Code

A template notebook is provided as `asl_recognizer.ipynb`. The notebook is a combination tutorial and submission document.  Some of the codebase and some of your implementation will be external to the notebook. For submission, complete the **Submission** sections of each part.  This will include running your implementations in code notebook cells, answering analysis questions, and passing provided unit tests provided in the codebase and called out in the notebook. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `AIND_recognizer/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following command:

`jupyter notebook asl_recognizer.ipynb`

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook in your browser which is where you will directly edit and run your code. Follow the instructions in the notebook for completing the project.


### Additional Information
##### Provided Raw Data

The data in the `asl_recognizer/data/` directory was derived from 
the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php). 
The handpositions (`hand_condensed.csv`) are pulled directly from 
the database [boston104.handpositions.rybach-forster-dreuw-2009-09-25.full.xml](boston104.handpositions.rybach-forster-dreuw-2009-09-25.full.xml). The three markers are:

*   0  speaker's left hand
*   1  speaker's right hand
*   2  speaker's nose
*   X and Y values of the video frame increase left to right and top to bottom.

Take a look at the sample [ASL recognizer video](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/download/021.avi)
to see how the hand locations are tracked.

The videos are sentences with translations provided in the database.  
For purposes of this project, the sentences have been pre-segmented into words 
based on slow motion examination of the files.  
These segments are provided in the `train_words.csv` and `test_words.csv` files
in the form of start and end frames (inclusive).

The videos in the corpus include recordings from three different ASL speakers.
The mappings for the three speakers to video are included in the `speaker.csv` 
file.

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

![Sample Output][image1]

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. (Optional) __If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

6. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create (and activate) a new environment.

		```

10. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `dog-project` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
```

11. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

12. (Optional) **If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS)**, before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__
