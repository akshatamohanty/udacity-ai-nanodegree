# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree and Specializations
Udacity is a for-profit educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses (MOOCs). This specialization was offered by Udacity as two three-month semester program, covering topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as well as a Specialization in either Computer Vision, Natural Langugae Processing or Voice User Interfaces. I completed the nanodegree by completing 7 required projects with a capstone project in Voice User Interfaces. This is a collection of all my work towards the degree. 


## Project Descriptions

### Sudoku Solver
This was an introductory project to build a Sudoku Solver using contraint propogation. Template code was provided with python functions that needed to be completed. Students were also expected to answer questions about Constraint Propogation. The project was completed using Python 3, in an Anaconda environment.

### Isolation Agent
This was the second project in the nanodegree and we were required to build an adverserial game playing agent for the game - Isolation. Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. The template code for the game was provided and we had to implement the following - 
 - MinimaxPlayer: Agent using Minimax search
 - AlphaBetaPlayer: Agent using mplement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
 - AlphaBeta with Iterative Deepening: Alpha Beta Agent using Iterative Deeping
 - 3 different heuristics for position evaluation
 
Students were also required to summarize a research paper on Game Playing Agents and provide a report analyzing different heuristics for game board evaluation.
